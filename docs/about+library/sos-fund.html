<h1>The Stranded on State Holiday Fund</h1>

	
<body>
	
		<p>When we first came up with the name "Stranded on State," we thought it was a funny play on words to describe Madison nightlife. As students, and citizens alike we walk past homeless people every day, those who are actually stranded on State Street, with nowhere else to go.  In our goal of making people laugh, we hoped to contribute to our community here in Madison, but jokes can only go so far.  We always wanted a good way to help out, so we created a fundraiser for everyone to get in on. We are raising money for The Beacon, a homeless shelter in Madison that provides food, showers, and communications services to the homeless. We are also hosting a winter jacket drive in room () for The Beacon. <strong>If you would like to contribute venmo us @strandedonstate</strong>  Please come by to contribute what you can for those less fortunate this giving season. </p>
